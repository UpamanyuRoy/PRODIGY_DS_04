---

This task involves analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. By applying sentiment analysis techniques, we aim to categorize social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and identify trends and patterns in public perception.

### **Steps:**

1. Data Collection and Exploration:
   - Load the social media dataset (e.g., tweets.csv) using Pandas.
   - Inspect the datasetâ€™s structure and content using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()`.
   - Check for missing or irrelevant data and clean the dataset accordingly.

2. Text Preprocessing:
   - Remove special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary whitespace.
   - Convert text to lowercase and remove stopwords.
   - Apply stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Use pre-trained sentiment analysis libraries like `TextBlob`, `VADER`, or `NLTK` to assign sentiment scores.
   - Alternatively, apply machine learning models for sentiment classification.
   - Categorize sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral based on sentiment scores.

4. Data Visualization:
   - Create bar charts and pie charts to visualize the distribution of sentiment categories.
   - Use word clouds to highlight frequently mentioned words in different sentiment groups.
   - Plot sentiment trends over time to identify shifts in public opinion.
